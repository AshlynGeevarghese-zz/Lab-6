## How the software workds...
Once the software runs it will prompt you to enter a name and a month using the input function.
 The name is stored in a name variable attached to an input funtion which asks "What is your name?"
The month is stored in a month variable that is declared by an input funtion asking "what month were you born?"
The user inputted month is then passed thorugh the if and elif statments to see which condition the user inputted month satisfies. 
Once a condition is satistfied the corresponding seaon to the condition will be printed out in a print statment.
The print statment will say the user's name what month they entered and what season that month is apart of.
